# Conjugate Gradient Method

This repository contains implementations of various Conjugate Gradient methods for solving systems of linear equations of the form \(Ax = b\) and non-linear equations.

For running the linear conjugate gradient method, use the following command:
```bash
python linear_conjugate_gradient.py
```

To run the non-linear conjugate gradient method, use:
```bash
python nonlinear_conjugate_gradient.py
```

Following that, you can visualize the results by executing:
```bash
python plot.py
```
